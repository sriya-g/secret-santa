## Usage

### For Admins

1. Go to `/admin` and login with your admin password
2. Add family members to the system (each gets a unique login code)
3. Share the login codes with each person
4. Once everyone has added their wishlist, click "Generate Assignments" to create Secret Santa pairs
5. View all assignments to verify everything worked

### For Participants

1. Go to `/login` and enter your unique login code
2. Add 3-5 items to your wishlist with links
3. Save your wishlist
4. View your Secret Santa assignment to see who you're buying for
5. Check their wishlist for gift ideas

## Database Schema

- **Person**: Stores participant information and login codes
- **WishlistItem**: Stores gift items for each person
- **Assignment**: Tracks who gives to whom each year
- **AdminConfig**: Stores admin password (hashed)

## Secret Santa Algorithm

The application uses a derangement algorithm to ensure:
- Everyone gives to exactly one person
- Everyone receives from exactly one person
- No one gives to themselves
- Minimum of 3 people required
